## Open API Spec
One main OpenAPI Spec for the basic endpoints discussed.  This was manually written for proof-of-concept purposes.  For the long run you can consider tools like the following to generate this documentation for you if you prefere to define your data objects in code:
    * [flask-rest-api](https://flask-rest-api.readthedocs.io/en/stable/openapi.html)
    * [apispec](https://apispec.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

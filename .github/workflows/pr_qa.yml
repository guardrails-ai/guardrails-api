          ## NOTE:
          ## The below checks for a file named .version-change-type that is used to automatically increment the version number during publish flows.
          ## It also checks for changes in a file called RELEASENOTES.md that are used to auto-maintain a rolling CHANGELOG.
          ## This is commented out for now until we finalize what the publish/release flow will look like.
